# Abstract  

The hydrologic effect of replacing pasture or other short crops with trees is reasonably well understood on a mean annual basis. The impact on ﬂow regime, as described by the annual ﬂow duration curve (FDC) is less certain. A method to assess the impact of plantation establishment on FDCs was developed. The starting point for the analyses was the assumption that rainfall and vegetation age are the principal drivers of evapotranspiration. A key objective was to remove the variability in the rainfall signal, leaving changes in streamﬂow solely attributable to the evapotranspiration of the plantation. A method was developed to (1) ﬁt a model to the observed annual time series of FDC percentiles; i.e. 10th percentile for each year of record with annual rainfall and plantation age as parameters, (2) replace the annual rainfall variation with the long term mean to obtain climate adjusted FDCs, and (3) quantify changes in FDC percentiles as plantations age. Data from 10 catchments from Australia, South Africa and New Zealand were used. The model was able to represent ﬂow variation for the majority of percentiles at eight of the 10 catchments, particularly for the 10–50th percentiles. The adjusted FDCs revealed variable patterns in ﬂow reductions with two types of responses (groups) being identiﬁed. Group 1 catchments show a substantial increase in the number of zero ﬂow days, with low ﬂows being more affected than high ﬂows. Group 2 catchments show a more uniform reduction in ﬂows across all percentiles. The differences may be partly explained by storage characteristics. The modelled ﬂow reductions were in accord with published results of paired catchment experiments. An additional analysis was performed to characterise the impact of afforestation on the number of zero ﬂow days  $(N_{\mathrm{zero}})$  for the catchments in group 1. This model performed particularly well, and when adjusted for climate, indicated a signiﬁcant increase in $N_{\mathrm{zero}}$ . The zero ﬂow day method could be used to determine change in the occurrence of any given ﬂow in response to afforestation. The methods used in this study proved satisfactory in removing the rainfall variability, and have added useful insight into the hydrologic impacts of plantation establishment. This approach provides a methodology for understanding catchment response to afforestation, where paired catchment data is not available. $\copyright$  2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

# 1. Introduction  

Widespread afforestation through plantation estab- lishment on non-forested land represents a potentially signiﬁcant alteration of catchment evapotranspiration (ET). Using data collated from multiple catchment studies, researchers have demonstrated a consistent difference in ET between forests and grass or short crops, and the relationship between ET and rainfall on a mean annual basis ( Holmes and Sinclair, 1986; Vertessy and Bessard, 1999; Zhang et al., 1999, 2001 ). Once annual rainfall exceeds  $400–500\;\mathrm{mm}$ , there is an increasing divergence between forest and grassland ET ( Zhang et al., 2001 ). Research from South Africa in particular has demonstrated ﬂow reduction following afforestation with both pine and eucalypt species ( Bosch, 1979; Van Lill et al., 1980; Van Wyk, 1987; Bosch and Von Gadow, 1990; Scott and Smith, 1997; Scott et al., 2000 ). In regions, where water is an increasingly valuable resource, prediction of the long-term hydrologic impact of afforestation is a prerequisite for the optimal planning of catchment land use.  

Zhang et al. (1999, 2001)  developed simple and easily parameterised models to predict changes in mean annual ﬂows following afforestation. However, there is a need to consider the annual ﬂow regime as the relative changes in high and low ﬂows may have considerable site speciﬁc and downstream impacts.. Sikka et al. (2003)  recently showed a change from grassland to  Eucalyptus globulus  plantations in India decreased a low ﬂow index by a factor of two during the ﬁrst rotation (9 years), and by 3.75 during the second rotation, with more subdued impact on peak ﬂows. The index was deﬁned as the 10 day average ﬂow exceeded $95\%$  of the time, obtained from analysis of 10-day ﬂow duration curves.  Scott and Smith (1997)  reported proportionally greater reductions in low ﬂows (75–100th percentiles) than annual ﬂows from South African research catchments under conversions from grass to pine and eucalypt plantations, while  Bosch (1979)  found the greatest reduction in seasonal ﬂow from the summer wet season.  Fahey and Jackson (1997)  reported the reduction in peak ﬂows was twice that of total ﬂow and low ﬂows for pine afforestation in New Zealand. The generalisations that can be drawn from annual analyses, where processes and hydrologic responses are to a certain extent integrated may not

apply on a seasonal or shorter scale. Further, the observed impacts of any land use change on ﬂows may be exaggerated or understated depending on the prevailing climate. Observations of ﬂow during extended wet or dry spells, or with high annual variability can obscure the real impacts.  Fig. 1  plots annual FDCsover 12 years of plantation growth for one of the catchments used in this study, Pine Creek. The net change in ﬂow is obscured by rainfall variability; e.g. the greatest change in the FDC is in 1996, with the stream ﬂowing   $<20\%$  of the time. This may be compared with 2000, where there is substantially higher ﬂows.  

This paper presents the results of a project aimed at quantifying changes in annual ﬂow regime of catchments following plantation establishment. The ﬂow regime is represented by the ﬂow duration curve (FDC). The key assumption was that rainfall and forest age are the principal drivers of evapotranspira- tion. For any generalisation of response of the FDC to vegetation change, the variation in the annual climate signal must be removed. The time-tested solution to this problem is the paired-catchment (control versus treatment) experiment. The beneﬁts in such studies are manifold: unambiguous measures of trends, insights into the processes driving those trends, excellent opportunities for model parameter is ation and validation. However these data are not readily available for the range of treamtments and environ- ments required. Consequently, the aims of this project were to (1) ﬁt a model to the observed annual time series of FDC percentiles; i.e. 10th percentile for each year of record with annual rainfall and plantation age as parameters, (2) replace the annual rainfall variation with the long term mean to obtain climate adjusted FDCs, and (3) quantify changes in FDC percentiles as plantations age. If the climate signal, represented by rainfall, could be successfully removed, the resulting changes in the FDC would be solely attributable to the vegetation.  

# 2. Methods  

# 2.1. Character is ation of ﬂow regime  

Flow duration curves display the relationship between streamﬂow and the percentage of time the streamﬂow is exceeded as a cumulative density function They can be constructed for any time period (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) and provide a graphical and statistical view of historic streamﬂow variability in a single catchment or a comparison of inter- catchment ﬂow regimes.  Vogel and Fennessey (1994) and  Smakhtin (1999, 2001)  demonstrate the utility (and caveats) of FDCs in characterising, comparing and predicting ﬂow regimes at varying temporal scales.  Fig. 1  is an example of annual FDCs constructed from daily ﬂows. For the consideration of annual ﬂow regime, daily ﬂows are an appropriate time step for FDC construction.  

FDCs were computed from the distribution of daily ﬂows for each year of record based on the appropriate water years (May–April or November–October) for 10 Southern Hemisphere catchments. Each 10th percentile (decile) was extracted from the annual FDCs of each catchment to form the data sets for analysis. For the purpose of characterising changes in each of the deciles, it is assumed that the time series is principally a function of climate and vegetation characteristics. Given rainfall is generally the most important factor affecting streamﬂow and the most easily accessed data, it is chosen to represent the climate. Catchment physical properties such as soil properties and topography are assumed to be time invariant and therefore their impact on runoff is considered constant throughout the analysis. As trees intercept and transpire at increasing rates until canopy closure, a time term is required to represent plantation growth. A simple model relating the time series of each decile with rainfall and vegetation characteristics can be expressed as:  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{Q_{\%}=f(P)+g(T)}\end{array}
$$  

where $Q_{\mathcal{k}}$  is the percentile ﬂow, $f(P)$  is a function of rainfall and   $g(T)$  is a function of the age of the plantation. Annual rainfall was chosen as the rainfall statistic as it proved to be the most robust predictor of ﬂow over the whole range of ﬂow percentiles, as compared with rainfall percentiles; e.g. median rain- fall versus 10th ﬂow percentile. The use of annual rainfall also minimises parameter complexity. The choice of model form is dependent on selecting a function that describes the relationship between forest age and ET.  Scott and Smith (1997)  demonstrated cumulative reductions in annual and low ﬂows resulting from afforestation ﬁtted a sigmoidal function, similar to forest growth functions. Conse- quently, we used a sigmoidal function to characterise the impact of plantation growth on each ﬂow decile. Fig. 2 a is a schematic of the change in the FDC over time. The model took the form:  

$$
Q_{\mathcal{U}}=a+b(\Delta P)+\frac{Y}{1+\exp\!\left(\frac{T-T_{\mathrm{half}}}{S}\right)}
$$  

where   $Q_{\mathcal{k}}$  is the percentile ﬂow (i.e. $Q_{50}$  is the 50th percentile ﬂow),   $Y$  and   $S$  are coefﬁcients of the sigmoidal term, $\Delta P$  is the deviation of annual rainfall from the period of record average, and $T_{\mathrm{half}}$  is the time in years at which half of the reduction in $Q_{\mathbb{X}}$  due to afforestation has taken place. For the average climate condition   $\Delta P\!=\!0$ , $a$  becomes the value of $Q_{\mathrm{\small{\mathscr{k}}}}$  when the new equilibrium plantation water use under afforestation is reached.  Y  then gives the magnitude of change due to afforestation, and   $S$  describes the shape of the response as shown in  Fig. 2 b. For the average pre-treatment condition   $\Delta P\!=\!0$  at   $T{=}0$ , $Q_{\mathrm{\%}}$  approximately equals $a+Y.$ . Estimation of a pre- afforestation condition would not require the time term. Details of the optimisation scheme and sensitivity tests on initial parameter values are given in  Lane et al. (2003) .

# 2.2. Zero ﬂow day analysis  

A notable feature of  Fig. 1  is the increase in the number of zero ﬂow days. A similar approach to Eq. (2), using an inverse sigmoidal function was employed to assess the impact of afforestation on the number of zero ﬂow days per year  $(N_{\mathrm{zero}})$ . In this case, the left hand side of Eq. (2) is replaced by $N_{\mathrm{zero}}$ , and $b$ and $S$  are constrained to negative as $N_{\mathrm{zero}}$  decreases as rainfall increases, and increases with plantation growth:  

$$
N_{\mathrm{zero}}=a+b(\Delta P)+\frac{Y}{1+\exp\left(\frac{T-T_{\mathrm{half}}}{S}\right)}
$$  

For the average pre-treatment condition   $\Delta P\!=\!0$ and   $T\!\!=\!0,\ N_{\mathrm{zero}}$  approximately equals   $a,~Y$  gives the magnitude of change in zero ﬂow days due to afforestation, and   $S$  describes the shape of the response. For the average climate condition $\Delta P\!=\!0$ , $a+Y$  becomes the number of zero ﬂow days when the new equilibrium condition under afforestation is reached.  

# 2.3. Statistical analyses  

The coefﬁcient of efﬁciency  $(E)$  ( Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970; Chiew and McMahon, 1993; Legates and McCabe, 1999 ) was used as the ‘goodness of ﬁt’ measure to evaluate the ﬁt between observed and predicted ﬂow deciles (2) and zero ﬂow days (3). $E$  is given by:  

$$
E=1.0-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(O_{i}-P_{i})^{2}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(O_{i}-\bar{O})^{2}}
$$  

where   $o$  are observed data,   $P$  are predicted values, and $\bar{O}$  is the mean for the entire period. $E$  is unity minus the ratio of the mean square error to the variance in the observed data, and ranges from   $-\infty$  to 1.0. Higher values indicate greater agreement between observed and predicted data as per the coefﬁcient of determination  $(r^{2})$ . $E$  is used in preference to   $r^{2}$   in evaluating hydrologic modelling because it is a measure of the deviation from the 1:1 line. As $E$  is always   $<\!r^{2}$   we have arbitrarily considered $E\!>\!0.7$  to indicate adequate model ﬁts.  

It is important to assess the signiﬁcance of the model parameters to check the model assumptions that rainfall and forest age are driving changes in the FDC. The model (2) was split into simpliﬁed forms, where only the rainfall or time terms were included by setting $b\!=\!0$ , as shown in Eq. (5), or   $Y{=}\,0$  as shown in Eq. (6). The component models (5) and (6) were then tested against the complete model, (2).  

$$
Q_{\mathcal{Q}}=a+\frac{Y}{1+\exp\left(\frac{T-T_{\mathrm{half}}}{S}\right)}
$$  

and  

$$
Q_{\%}=a+b\Delta P
$$  

For both the ﬂow duration curve analysis and zero ﬂow days analysis, a $t\cdot$ -test was then performed to test whether (5) and (6) were signiﬁcantly different to (2). A critical value of   $t$  exceeding the calculated $t\cdot$ -value  

Table 1 Site characteristics for all catchments 
![](images/5483d898a3b21eb6a8d0a9f62c72d26a405ecfc1fff3b4717aadafb7a8e66a19.jpg)

when comparing (5) and (2) would indicate the time term in (6) was required to improve the complete model and is therefore signiﬁcant, and vice versa.  

Due to the constraint that the rainfall and time term must be positive, a one tailed $t\cdot$ -test was applied. The $t\cdot$ -value was calculated as   $F^{0.5}$ , and compared with the critical value for signiﬁcance at the 0.05 level. The $F$ -statistic was calculated as:  

$$
F=\frac{[(\mathrm{SSE_{s}-S S E_{c}})/(\mathrm{df_{c}-d f_{s}})]}{\mathrm{SSE_{c}/d f_{c}}}
$$  

where SSE is the residual sum of the squared errors, df is degrees of freedom, and the subscripts s and c refer to the simpliﬁed model and complete models, respectively.  

# 3. Data sets  

Daily streamﬂow data were obtained from 10 catchment studies from southeastern Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The initial criteria for selection of these catchments were a known veg- etation history and streamﬂow records of good quality. The ideal data sets were those with a lengthy pre- and post-treatment (plantation establishment) ﬂow record with approximately  $100\%$  of the catch- ment converted from grassland or a crop equivalent to plantation. In reality, all these criteria were not easy to satisfy. For example in Victoria, Australia, the best data is from Stewarts Creek, a set of decommissioned research catchments with 9 years of pre-treatment data and 25 years of post-treatment. Here, though, the treatment was a conversion from native eucalypt forest to pine. The assumption made for this data set is that the immediate post-treatment period may be viewed as a non-forested condition. This condition is likely to approximate the ET conditions of pasture or short crops for up to 3 years. Catchment details and treatments are given in  Table 1 .  

All catchments, with the exception of Traralgon Creek, were afforested with pine species, predomi- nantly  Pinus radiata , with $P$ . patula  planted at the two Cathedral Peak catchments. Traralgon Creek has only $6\%$  pine, with the remainder eucalypts species, most of which is  Eucalyptus regnans .  

Table 2 Signiﬁcance of the rainfall and time terms 
![](images/76e550cc52f59acbf895806bc1e1b2be14f6d6d3b35b21568db783a28ac7064f.jpg)  
$P$  indicates that the rainfall term was signiﬁcant at the $5\%$  level, $T$  indicates that the time term was signiﬁcant at the $5\%$  level, \* represents signiﬁcance at the  $10\%$  level, and na denotes too few data points for meaningful analysis.  

Data on soil characteristics have been obtained from published reports and personal communication with researchers, but is far from uniform, particularly regarding porosity. Consequently only an indication of mean depth is reported here. However, this does give some indication of the likely relative storage capacities of the catchments. To obtain insights into the pre-afforestation hydrologic characteristics a baseﬂow separation was performed on the daily ﬂows for the ﬁrst 3 years following disturbance, using the digital ﬁltering method of  Lyne and Hollick (1979)  with a ﬁlter coefﬁcient of 0.925 and three passes. The resultant average baseﬂow index (BFI), the ratio of baseﬂow to total ﬂow, is given in  Table 1 . The Australian catchments display a notably lower BFI than the South African and New Zealand catchments. For Stewarts Creek, Pine Creek and Redhill the lower BFI is matched by the shallow soils. Pre-treatment data is not available for all catchment in the data set, so it was decided for the sake of consistency in the analysis to start each of the data sets in the year of treatment. The FDCs were constructed for water years of May–April for eight catchments. The 2 Cathedral Peak catchments were analysed for November–October because of the summer rainfall maxima ( Table 2 ).

The ﬁt of the complete model, Eq. (2), to the observed data was generally good.  Table 2  gives

the coefﬁcient of efﬁciency  $(E)$  for each ﬂow percentile at all the catchments. The majority of ﬁts $(77\%)$  returned $E\!>\!0.7$ , with  $60\%~0.8$  or better. The signiﬁcance of the rainfall and time terms is given in Table 3  for all deciles, where solutions were found. There were not enough data to ﬁt the model in ﬁve instances because of extended periods of zero ﬂows. This problem is addressed to some extent in the zero ﬂow analysis. If the rainfall signal is to be separated from the vegetation signal the rainfall terms must be signiﬁcant. This term,   $b$ , was signiﬁcant for $75\%$  of the deciles at the 0.05 level, and a further $9\%$  at the 0.10 level. The incidence of signiﬁcance was greatest for the 10–50th percentiles at 45 of the 50 data sets at the 0.05 level. The time term,   $Y$  returned similar results, with  $80\%$  of the deciles signiﬁcant at 0.05 level. There were an additional  $9\%$  of deciles signiﬁcant at the 0.10 level.  

The poorest $E$  values were those from Lambrechts- bos A and B. The high   $E$  for 50–100th deciles at Biesievlei, where $b$  was not signiﬁcant are notable. In general the model ﬁts the higher ﬂows (lower deciles) better, most of the poorer ﬁts are in the 80–100 percentile range. This can be expected given the results of the signiﬁcance tests for   $b$ . The results of the sensitivity analysis suggested that the   $E$  values for Glendhu 2 and for 10th and 20th percentiles from Cathedral Peak 3 may exaggerate the goodness of ﬁt to the exact form of the model ( Lane et al., 2003 ).  

# 4.2. Adjusted FDCs—magnitude of ﬂow reductions  

Following the successful ﬁtting of (2) to the observed percentiles, the FDCs were adjusted for climate by setting   $\Delta P$  to zero, representing long term average annual rainfall. The climate adjusted FDCs produce an estimation of the change in ﬂow percentiles over time for each catchment due to afforestation that may be viewed in two forms: new FDCs, adjusted for climate, as exempliﬁed in  Fig. 3 for Stewarts Creek 5, and a comparison between all catchments of the maximum change in yield (given by Y ) for each ﬂow percentile from baseline ﬂows (given by   $a+Y)$  as shown in  Fig. 4 . Where the new equilibrium of maximum water use is reached, the adjusted FDCs for individual years should be identical if rainfall variability has been accounted for. The new equilibrium is approximately reached for   $T{=}\,2T_{\mathrm{half}}$ .  

![](images/2578542d1ffa19ad2c65826564a21a2b962d5bf99877b903d992285e0342d74d.jpg)  
Fig. 3. Examples of observed and ﬂow duration curves adjusted for average rainfall following afforestation for Stewarts Creek 5, Australia.  

$T_{\mathrm{half}}$  values are given in  Table 4 .  Fig. 3  shows that for most deciles the adjusted FDCs are identical for 12 and 20 years after treatment. This ﬁgure clearly demonstrates the necessity for FDC adjustment, particularly for the 20 years FDC.  

The relative net ﬂow change due to afforestation is given by $Y/(Y+a)$ , which represents the change from the old equilibrium water use condition of pre-treatment vegetation to the new equilibrium condition at forest canopyclosure.This quantity is plotted for all catchment s in  Fig. 4 . Some deciles have been removed from the data set, the 10th and 50th percentile for Glendhu 2 and the 10th and 20th percentiles from Cathedral Peak 3. The optimised value of  a waszero or near zerofor these cases, which is not consistent with the conceptual model. The changes shown in  Fig. 4  are variable. However, there are some commonalities between catchment responses. Two types of responses (groups) were identiﬁed. Group 1 catchments show a substantial increase in the number of zero ﬂow days, with a greater proportional reduction in low ﬂows than high ﬂows. Group 2 catchments show a more uniform proportional reduction in ﬂows across all percentiles, albeit with some variability. The catchments in each group are:  

Group 1: Stewarts Creek, Pine Creek, and Redhill Group 2: Cathedral Peak 2 and 3, Lambrechtsbos A, Lambrechtsbos B, Glendhu 2, Biesievlei and Traralgon Creek

Fig. 4. Net ﬂow reductions   $Y/(Y+a)$  for all catchments.  

Group 1 exhibit both the highest reduction of ﬂows overall, and show the largest proportional reduction at lower ﬂows, leading to a complete cessation of ﬂow. Comparison of ﬂow reductions is hindered slightly by the range of afforestation at the catchments ( Table 1 ). These results could be scaled up to  $100\%$  afforested if it is assumed there is a linear relationship between the area planted and ﬂow reductions. As there is no evidence that this is the case we have not presented scaled reductions here. Linear scaling would shift the reduction curves upward for those catchments that are less than $100\%$  afforested, but would not change the shape of the curves or our groupings.  

# 4.3. Timing of ﬂow reductions  

The speed of ﬂow responses to afforestation can be evaluated by examining the value of $T_{\mathrm{half}}$ ( Table4 ).There is substantial variation in response times both over the percentile spread in some individual catchments, and between the catchments. The majority of responses have a   $T_{\mathrm{half}}$  value between 5 and 10 years. Pine Creek and StewartsCreek,Redhill and Lam brecht s bos A exhibit the fastest responses, with Biesievlei showing the most uniformly slow response.   $T_{\mathrm{half}}$  for the South African catchments display a good correspondence to published annual changes ( Scott et al., 2000; Van Wyk, 1987 ), excepting the 10–20th deciles for both Cathedral Peak

# 4.4. Comparison with paired catchment studies  

A further check on the overall model performance is a comparison with published results of paired catchment studies. The data that can be compared with our results are presented in  Table 5  and can be broadly compared with  Fig. 4 . These data are reductions in years with near average annual rainfall, and at a time after treatment when maximum changes in streamﬂow have occurred. Table 5  also includes estimates on the total and low ﬂow reductions calculated from this study. Results from Pine Creek and Traralgon Creek are not included in  Table 5 as these catchments are not paired. Exact comparisons are impossible because of the rainfall variability, and lack of calibration period for Redhill. Despite this, Table 5  shows that total and low ﬂow reductions estimated from our study are comparable to the results from paired catchment studies, indicating that our simple model has successfully removed the rainfall signal.  

# 4.5. Zero ﬂow days  

As this analysis could only be applied, where there was consistent drying up of streams, it was conﬁned to Stewarts Creek, Pine Creek and Redhill catchments. The model returned values of $E$  of 0.95, 0.99 and 0.99, respectively. The   $t\cdot$ -tests on   $b$  and   $\Delta N_{\mathrm{zero}}$  returned signiﬁcant results at the 0.05 level for both parameters at all three catchments. The climate adjusted zero ﬂow days are shown in  Fig. 5 . The increases in zero ﬂow days are substantial with ﬂows conﬁned to less than $50\%$  of the time by year 8 at Stewarts $\mathrm{Ck}$  and Pine $\mathrm{Ck}$  and year 11 at Redhill. The latter has changed from an almost permanent to a highly intermittent stream. The curves are also in sensible agreement with the ﬂow reductions in  Fig. 4 .  

# 5. Discussion  

The aims of the project have largely been met. The general character is ation of FDCs and adjustment for climate has been very encouraging given the task of ﬁtting our model to 10 ﬂow percentiles, for 10 different catchments (resulting in 100 model ﬁts) with

substantially varying spatial scales, soils and geology, species planted and climatic environments. Although there were poor results for individual deciles, the FDCs at eight of the 10 catchments were adequately described by Eq. (2). The results of the statistical tests in which the rainfall term was signiﬁcant for most deciles demon- strated the model structure was appropriate for adjusting the FDCs for climatic (rainfall) variability. The comparisons of our results with published paired catchment analyses are satisfactory, although the different methodologies make direct comparisons of deciles with total ﬂow uncertain. Low ﬂows at Lambrechtsbos B appear to be over-estimated by our model, which is unsurprising as the model ﬁt was poor. The remaining four South African catchments, and also Redhill and Stewarts Creek are in good agreement with the published values, particularly when the deviation of average rainfall is considered. Glendhu 2 reductions are close to the reported  $27\%$ , but our model produces a heavier impact on the lower ﬂows. Overall, it appears there are no signiﬁcant discrepancies with the published paired catchment analyses. We suggest our technique represents an alternative to the paired-catchment method for assessing hydrologic response to vegetation treat- ment, where paired data are unavailable. The method has not yet resulted in a predictive model, but has increased our knowledge of afforestation impacts. This is a valuable outcome given the contentious issue of afforestation in Australia and other countries, and a current paucity of data on inter-annual ﬂows. It should be noted that nine of the 10 catchment were pine species. More data is required to compare the impact of hardwood species, particularly eucalypts, on the FDC. Unfortunately these data are currently scarce. There are substantial data on the physiological controls of eucalypt water use (see  Whitehead and Beadle, 2004 ), but not at the catchment scale.  

The model ﬁts show we have quantiﬁed the net impact of afforestation for the majority of the ﬂow percentiles in the 10 catchments. Results for the 10–50th percentiles were particularly encouraging. It is not surprising that the relationship between rainfall and ﬂow diminishes at lower ﬂows (60–100th percentile), where seasonal storage effects and rainfall distribution become more important drivers for runoff generation. The poorest model ﬁts were gained for Lambrechtsbos A and B. The likely reason at Lambrechtsbos A is an observed annual decrease in stand water use after 12 years ( Scott et al., 2000 ) which does not conform to the sigmoidal form of our model over the full 19 years of record. The failure of the model to ﬁt the lower ﬂows at Lambrechtsbos B is not as explicable. A decrease in stand water use in this catchment is observed as the plantation ages, but does not occur during the ﬁrst 20 years after treatment ( Scott et al., 2000 ). Other data from South Africa ( Scott et al., 2000 ) indicate there are diminished ﬂow reductions as plantations age, but again, generally after 20 years. Our use of an asymptotic curve assumes a new equilibrium of stand water use is reached. The results of the model ﬁtting generally justify this assumption for the length of commercial plantation growth (up to 20 years) considered here. The physio- logical relationship between stand age and water use for plantation species other than $E.$ . regnans  have not been thoroughly investigated, although  Cornish and Vertessy (2001) and Roberts et al. (2001)  have shown young mixed species eucalypt forests may use more water than mature stands, and  Putahena and Cordery (2000)  suggest maximum  Pinus radiata  water use may have been reached after 12 years, with a subsequent decline.  

The small Australian catchments converted to pine in response group 1 (Stewarts Creek 5, Pine Creek and Redhill) have similar shallow soils, potential evapo- transpiration and rainfall distribution (relatively uni- form) although Stewarts Creek is signiﬁcantly wetter. The combination of small catchment area and the increased transpirative demand that exceeds summer and autumn rainfall and stored water results in the large impact on lower ﬂows, compared to high ﬂows.  

The magnitude of the response within Group 2 varies considerably, with greater reduction in ﬂows in the two Cathedral Peak catchments, and Lambrechtsbos B. Potential evaporation is in phase with rainfall at the Cathedral Peak sites as they receive $85\%$  ( $1260\,\mathrm{mm}$  on average) of their rainfall in summer. The conjunction of peak demand and plant water availability may explain the high reductions relative to the remaining catchments in Group 2. In addition, the stocking density was described as ‘abnormally dense’ by  Scott et al. (2000) . Growth at Glendhu 2 was notably slow ( Fahey and Jackson, 1997 ) and Lambrechtsbos A and Biesievlei are described as being within sub optimal growth zones ( Scott and Smith, 1997 ) characterised by these authors as having relatively slow response times and lesser reductions that those at more optimal sites.  

The response groups may be in part explained by the storage characteristics of the catchments. Accurate measures of storage are not available from the literature, but the soil depths and the baseﬂow index ( Table 1 ) both show the three south eastern Australian catchments with the greatest reduction are likely to have the lowest storage capacity. The greater ﬂow reductions, particu- larly for low ﬂows, could be expected under these conditions. Inclusion of a storage term in the model is an obvious option for improving the analysis. However the addition of extra parameters would be at the cost of maintaining model simplicity, particularly as character- ising a transient storage is not trivial.  

Traralgon Creek would be expected to have both the most subdued ﬂow reductions and longer response time because of the large area of   $E$ . regnans  forest, and uncertain vegetation record. Peak stand water use of a natural stand of this species is around 30 years. Additionally in this large, ‘real world’ catchment, there is a continuous cycle of forest management which includes harvesting. A mixture of pasture and ‘scrub’, which could represent signiﬁcant understorey stands, were replaced by plantation species. Conse- quently the difference between pre and post treatment ET may be less than at other catchments. Reductions of this magnitude could be more readily expected in larger, multi land use catchments than the very high impacts estimated at the smaller Australian catchments.  

The analysis of zero ﬂow days was successful, demonstrating that the impact on ﬂow intermittence can be evaluated without of the entire FDC. This was helpful as the change in the higher percentiles (low ﬂows) could not always be modelled. The results for the three catchments analysed are a rather stark indication of the potential for highly increased zero ﬂow periods in small catchments, at least in south-eastern Australia. However, it should be noted these curves probably represent a maximum response as they are all derived from small catchments with small storage capacities and large percentages of afforestation. This method could be used to determine change in the occurrence of any given ﬂow in response to afforestation; e.g. to determine the likelihood of maintaining a reservoir storage or an environmental ﬂow that requires an average critical ﬂow.  

# 6. Summary and conclusions  

This project sought to(i)develop a method to remove the climate signal from streamﬂow records to identify the impact of vegetation on ﬂow from afforested catchments, and (ii) quantify this impact on the ﬂow duration curve. A simple model was proposed that considered the age of plantation and the annual rainfall to be the principal drivers for evapotranspiration. This model was ﬁtted to the observed deciles of the FDC, and the climate signal was then removed from the stream- ﬂow records by adjusting the FDC for average rainfall over the period of record. The model was tested and applied to 10 afforested catchments. We successfully ﬁtted our model to catchments with varying spatial scales, species and environments, and haveshown thatit provides a means of separating the inﬂuence of climate and vegetation on the FDCs. The modelled results showed the greatest proportional impacts were for median and lower ﬂows. The ﬂow reductions from the three small catchments SE Australian were the highest and may reﬂect lower storages. The character is ation of the number of zero ﬂow days was also successful for these catchments in indicating a signiﬁcant increase in zero ﬂows. The ﬂow reductions identiﬁed here probably represent a maximum effect given the size of the catchments, level of afforestation and the shallow soils. These results have yielded useful new insights on the contentious issue of the hydrological impact of afforestation. This research has led to the development of a method to assess the net impact of afforestation on the ﬂow duration curve which does not require paired- catchments to remove climatic variability.
